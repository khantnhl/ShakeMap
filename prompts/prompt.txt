Use the video, audio and text
in this social media post shared by a person who felt an earthquake to estimate the intensity of
ground shaking at its location in the MMI Scale.


the input video/image using a one-shot prompt:
‘Analyse the provided image/video and extract
any information that indicates the location of
the user or post. Identify the specific location
name, including city, state (if applicable) and
country. Limit your response only to the extracted
location. Example output: Imperial, CA’


‘felt by user’: ‘Yes’,
‘class source’: ‘Surveillance Footage (YouTube)’,
‘post location’: ‘Boonton, NJ (based on the news ticker)’,
‘post date time’: ‘April 5, 2024 (exact time not specified)’,
‘earthquake location’: ‘North-east U.S. (N18V)’,
‘earthquake magnitude’: ‘4.8 (provided in video description)’,
‘distance to earthquake epicentre’: ‘37.59 km (provided by user)’,
‘shaking duration’: ‘Several seconds, as observed in the video footage’,
‘building type’: ‘Coffee shop (commercial building)’,
‘building materials’: ‘Unknown’,
‘human reaction’: ‘Panic and fear, evident from their hurried movements, seeking cover under tables, and expressions of distress.’,
‘animals reaction’: ‘Not visible in the video’,
‘furnishing’: ‘Tables, chairs, light fixtures, and other typical coffee shop items’,
‘language’: ‘English’,
‘natural environment’: ‘Not visible in the video’,
‘video evidence’: {
‘Object Movement’: ‘Visible shaking of light fixtures and furniture, indicating ground movement.’,
‘People Running and Seeking Cover’: ‘Individuals exhibiting panicked behaviour, rushing for exits, and taking cover under tables, demonstrating a perception
of danger.’,
‘Limited Object Falling’: ‘Some small objects may appear to be falling or displaced, but the video quality makes it difficult to ascertain the extent.’},
‘audio evidence’: {
‘Sounds of Distress’: ‘People expressing fear and concern, with exclamations like ‘Earthquake!’ and ‘Mommy!’’,
‘Background Noise’: ‘General coffee shop ambiance and potential sounds of objects rattling or moving.’},
‘textual evidence’: {
‘Video Description’: ‘Provides information about the earthquake’s magnitude and location.’,
‘News Overlay’: ‘Mentions tremors lasting several seconds and being felt 200 miles away, suggesting a wider impact of the earthquake.’},
‘mmi estimation’: ‘MMI IV or MMI V’,
‘mid mmi value numeric’: ‘4.5',
‘estimation confidence’: ‘0.7',
‘visual observation’: ‘The video evidence suggests moderate ground shaking, with notable movement of objects and people reacting with fear and taking cover.
The absence of significant damage or widespread falling objects indicates that the intensity is likely not higher than MMI V.’,
‘auditory cues’: ‘The audio evidence supports the visual observations, with people’s vocal expressions of fear and distress indicating a level of alarm consistent
with moderate shaking.’,
‘textual information’: ‘The video description and news overlay provide valuable context about the earthquake’s magnitude and its broader impact, reinforcing
the assessment of moderate shaking intensity.’,
‘analysis of evidences’: ‘The combined evidence from visual, auditory and textual sources points to an earthquake intensity in the range of MMI IV to MMI V
at the coffee shop location. The observed effects align with the characteristics of these MMI levels, where objects move notably, people feel frightened and
react, but significant damage is not widespread.’,
‘reasoning’: ‘The observed effects, such as the shaking of light fixtures and furniture, people’s reactions, and the lack of major damage, are consistent with the
descriptions of MMI IV and V. The distance from the epicentre and the earthquake’s magnitude also support this estimation.’}
