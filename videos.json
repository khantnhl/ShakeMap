The observed damage, being a total collapse of a substantial building, exceeds 'partial collapse' of MMI IX and approaches the 'destroyed' criteria of MMI X for that specific structure. The presence of an adjacent, seemingly intact building prevents a higher MMI (like XI or XII) which would imply widespread destruction. Auditory cues of loud collapse sounds and human distress (shouting about trapped people) further support a high intensity event causing panic and severe structural failure. The rapid nature of the collapse also points to intense, sudden ground motion. The lack of information on the building's specific construction quality or the extent of damage to other structures in the wider area limits a more precise MMI determination, but the observed single-building collapse is extremely severe.",
